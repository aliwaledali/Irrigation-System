# Irrigation-System-
This project focuses on creating an automated irrigation system using an Arduino microcontroller, a real time clock RTC module, an EEPROM module, and relay modules. The primary purpose of this system is to efficiently control the water supply for plants based on soil moisture levels, reducing water waste and ensuring plants receive adequate hydration without human intervention. This is particularly useful for remote or small-scale agriculture setups, such as balcony gardens, where constant monitoring may not be feasible.
