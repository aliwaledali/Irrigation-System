Circuit Overview and Main Components
1.	Arduino Uno: The main control unit of the system, responsible for receiving time information from the RTC and controlling the relay to turn the water pump on and off according to a set schedule.
2.	RTC (Real-Time Clock) - PCF8563: This component provides real-time tracking, allowing the Arduino to follow a programmed schedule. The RTC ensures that the irrigation system activates the water pump at specific times of the day, making the system more autonomous and precise.
3.	Relay Module: The relay functions as an electronic switch, controlled by the Arduino. When the programmed time is reached, the Arduino activates the relay to turn on the water pump.
4.	Water Pump: Connected to the relay, the pump supplies water to the plants. It operates on a timed schedule managed by the RTC and Arduino, ensuring consistent irrigation.
5.	EEPROM - AT24C256: Used for non-volatile storage, allowing the system to save irrigation schedules and settings even if the power is turned off. This ensures that schedules are maintained without needing reprogramming after a reset.
6.	Power Supply: Powers the circuit, including the Arduino, RTC module, and pump.
